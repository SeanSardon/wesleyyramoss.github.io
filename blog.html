<p>A a kid I loved and was very intrigued with photgraphy and how it could capture
				   a moments in life. Well as I progess in school and in the world my dream is to 
				   take photgraphy as a full time job. My plan is to move to San Francisco and go 
				   to SF university to learn more about photgraphy and take to do some street and 
				   urban photo shoots. I plan to stay in San Francisco because I love the culture 
				   there and how everyone is chill and hippie. This my dream and goal in life.</p>
